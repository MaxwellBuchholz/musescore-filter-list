# MuseScore Filter List
Filter list for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) to block unwanted features and advertisements on [Musescore.com](https://musescore.com/)

Copy the desired link, navigate to the uBlock's "Filter lists" page, and paste it into the import section at the very bottom.

- [Advertisement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxwellBuchholz/musescore-filter-list/refs/heads/main/advertisements.txt)
- [Anti-PRO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxwellBuchholz/musescore-filter-list/refs/heads/main/anti-pro.txt)
- [Main](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxwellBuchholz/musescore-filter-list/refs/heads/main/main.txt)

Alternatively, for customization, you can copy the contents of the files into uBlock's "My filters" page and customize it to your liking, this is recommended for main.txt as it contains many features that you may or may not want.
